# DaddyWorkspace
Project to build AI agent workflows at https://github.com/nol3jrs/daddyworkspace.

## Setup
- Pull from https://github.com/nol3jrs/daddyworkspace.
- Folders: src/ (code), diagrams/ (Draw.io XML), docs/ (requirements, tasks), deploy/ (scripts).
- Visuals: Use Draw.io XML in code blocks for import/viewing.
- Security: Use .env for API keys (e.g., Grok API from https://x.ai/api). Review commits for leaks.
- Track requirements in docs/requirements.md, tasks in docs/deploy-tasks.md.
