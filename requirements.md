# Requirements for DaddyWorkspace AI Agent Ecosystem

## Met (Baseline from Voice Interaction Setup)
- Basic page structure: Title and layout elements in place.
- UI elements: Buttons for "Start Voice Input" and "Speak Response"; text area placeholder.

## Pending (Expanded from History)
- Voice input: Integrate Web Speech API for speech-to-text; trigger on button click, display real-time transcription.
- Response handling: Link to Grok/xAI API for input processing; generate responses based on agent context.
- Text-to-speech: Use browser APIs for speaking responses; add controls for stop/resume.
- Error handling: Check mic permissions, browser support; fallbacks like text input if voice fails.
- UI enhancements: Loading indicators, real-time display, accessibility tweaks.
- Security: Secure API keys via env vars; avoid exposing in client-side code.
- Deployment: Host on GitHub Pages; add to Deployment Task List for tracking steps.

## New/Expanded (From Latest Input)
### Workspace Structuring
- Leverage Grok memory/workspace for project convos: Store all related chats here for easy reference; no repeats unless needed.
- Easy code/config sharing: Use JSON files for n8n workflows (separate prod vs dev); sync via GitHub pushes.
- Reference past convos: Pull context from this thread/repo for continuity, but treat new msgs standalone if unrelated.
- Track files: Requirements (bullet list, met/pending), Designs (draw.io XML updates), Deployment Task List (completed/pending steps), JSON configs.

### Daddy Agent Development
- Core role: Acts as CEO/hub; calls sub-agents (CFO for budget, CTO for trading/backtesting, etc.).
- Memory integration: Own chat history tracking; persist across sessions (e.g., via database or file storage).
- Calling mechanism: API endpoints or triggers to summon subs; e.g., Personal Assistant talks to Daddy Agent to delegate.
- Workflow: Built in n8n or similar; handle routing, error logging, user auth if needed.
- Security review: Assess for vulnerabilities (e.g., API exposure); flag sensitive data, suggest env vars/private repos.

### Backtest Trading Strategy Agent
- Functionality: Run backtests on crypto strategies; capture metrics (ROI, drawdown, Sharpe ratio).
- Reporting: Generate reports (tables/graphs); store results for review.
- Inputs: Strategy params (e.g., indicators, timeframes); data sources (crypto APIs like Binance, but offline sim for backtest).
- Integration: Callable by Daddy Agent; use libs like pandas, backtrader in code exec if needed.

### YouTube Sentiment Tracker Agent
- Track sentiment: Analyze comments/videos for topics (e.g., crypto, stocks); use NLP to score positive/negative.
- Sources: YouTube API for fetching data; process in batches.
- Outputs: Daily/periodic reports; alerts on shifts.
- Integration: Daddy Agent trigger; store trends in workspace.

### Personal Assistant Agent
- Task tracking: Across subjects (work, personal, trading); prioritize daily (e.g., based on urgency/deadlines).
- Daily interaction: Scheduled prompts or voice/text chats; integrate voice UI from earlier for natural convos.
- Delegation: Communicate with Daddy Agent to call other subs (e.g., query budget status).
- Memory: Track user prefs, ongoing tasks; remind/sync via notifications.

### Budget Tracker Agent
- Functionality: Monitor expenses/income; categorize (e.g., trading fees, subscriptions).
- Reporting: Monthly summaries, forecasts; flag overspend.
- Inputs: User data uploads or API pulls (e.g., bank feeds if secure).
- Integration: Called by Daddy Agent; tie into Personal Assistant for task ties (e.g., budget-based priorities).
