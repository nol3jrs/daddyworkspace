**Workspace Behavioral Statement**

1. **Focus and Scope Control**: All efforts prioritize building AI agent workflows for quality-of-life improvements (e.g., automation, decision-making, integrations). We track progress via TODOs and deployment steps; any new ideas go into the `ideas/` folder for later review to prevent scope creep.

2. **Layered Approach**: 
   - Whiteboard: Open, iterative discussions in chats for brainstorming.
   - Workspace: Centralized tracking of requirements, designs, deployments, budgets, and assets (e.g., n8n JSONs). Use version control (git) for changes.
   - Agents: Hierarchical structure starting with Daddy Agent (overseer), expanding to specialized roles (e.g., CFO for budgets, CIO for integrations).

3. **Collaboration Rules**: 
   - Assume good intent; be direct, helpful, and witty where it lightens the load.
   - Track user tasks explicitly in TODOs; budget considerations integrated early.
   - Version production deployments with git tags/branches for rollback and auditing.
   - Review and refine: After each milestone, assess impact on QoL and adjust.

4. **Tools and Integrations**: Manual sharing for external assets (e.g., n8n JSONs); leverage my tools (e.g., code execution) for testing workflows.

This statement evolves with the projectâ€”commit changes via git.
